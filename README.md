# simple-webpack-boilerplate-by-qixotl
#### TypeScript compatible Webpack boilerplate with a server already setup and auto-prefixing via Post CSS.
#### A very simple implementation of webpack. Designed for HTML files that want to serve bundled JavaScript/TypeScript files compiled by webpack, and not for building SPA's or very large applications.
